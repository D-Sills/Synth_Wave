### Additional Comments and Highlights

I guess first things first, this is definitely not what you expected. Maybe not the best choice of project since I couldn't really implement more advanced phsyics or tilemaps(in a meaningful way), but I think the final result was pretty good. It would be easy enough to add more levels and songs, and I think the game is pretty fun to play. 

It could definetly use some polish, but time is tight at the moment as I'm sure you understand. Better level designs, improved feedback and visual effects would go a long way. The UI is also an eye sore big time.

All in all, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I think I did a good job of using the Defold engine, especially the messaging and GUI, and I learned a lot about the engine itself, and lua in general. While I'm not sure if I'll be using Defold in the future, I'm glad I got the chance to learn it.

I used FMOD for the audio, which is a 3rd party library and very powerful audio solution. I'm actually using it in my final year project, so I thought it would be a good idea to get some practice with it. I was pleasantly surprised by the Defold integration, which was done entirely by the community. It worked more or less seamlessly!
